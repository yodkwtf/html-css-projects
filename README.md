# HTML and CSS Projects

It consists a collection of my html and css projects including mini projects and cloned websites. The projects weren't big enough for an individual repo so I combined them in a single repo.

For more info regarding a specific project, navigate to that project's directory and check out its readme file.

## Here are the live previews of all the projects:

1. [Spotify Premium Page - Clone](https://spotifypage-dk.netlify.app/)
2. [Redux Website - Clone](https://reduxwebsite-dk.netlify.app/)
3. [Glass UI Website](https://glassuiwebsite-dk.netlify.app/)
4. [SVG Text Animation](https://svgtextanimation-dk.netlify.app/)
5. [SVG Shapes Animation](https://svgshapesanimation-dk.netlify.app/)
